# Overview

This project is an app titled **"Savings and Annuity Simulator,"** which is a simulation based on the present value formulas for investments with no annuity, a fixed annuity, and a growing annuity. The three colored lines represent the three investing methods, and modifying the slider inputs changes the simulation of the investment's performance on the graph shown and in the table provided. 

The graph can be faceted to show the three investment methods as three graphs, with their corresponding areas. From left to right they are the no contribution (annuity) method, fixed annuity method, and growing annuity method. 

Also, below the sliders and the graph of the simulation a table is given of the balances per-year for each of the three investing modes, over a given length of time in years. 

The *default* values for the simulation when the app is first open are an initial investment of $1000, rate of return of 5%, length of time of 20 years, contribution of \$2000, a growth rate of 2%, and faceting turned off.
