Essentially, this package offers functions to calcualte distributions, measures, cumulative distributions, variables, and combinations from given trials, successes, and probabilities according to a binomial random distribution. 

#####The exported, public functions in this package are: 

* bin_choose() - takes inputs n and k 
* bin_probability() - takes inputs success, trials, prob
* bin_distribution() - takes inputs trials, prob
* bin_choose() - takes inputs trials, prob
* bin_choose() - takes inputs trials, prob
* bin_choose() - takes inputs trials, prob
* bin_choose() - takes inputs trials, prob
* bin_choose() - takes inputs trials, prob

The package also includes auxilary and checker functions. 

#####The inputs are: 

* trials (n)
* prob (p)
* success (k)
